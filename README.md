# Sea Battle Game Project

## Project Description

Welcome to the code repository for the Sea Battle Game project. This project aimed to create a classic battleship-style game that runs in the terminal, incorporating interprocess communication using various techniques such as pipes, sockets, message queues, and shared memory. While the project remains incomplete due to the challenges of implementing these features in Python, it serves as an educational endeavor and a foundation for further exploration.

## Project Goals

The primary objectives of this project were as follows:

1. **Battleship Gameplay**: Implement a classic battleship game where players can strategically place ships on a grid and take turns guessing the coordinates of their opponent's ships.

2. **Interprocess Communication**: Explore and implement various methods of interprocess communication, including pipes, sockets, message queues, and shared memory, to facilitate communication between game clients and the server.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several key files and modules:

- `server.py`: Contains the server-side code responsible for managing communication between clients and handling game logic (unfinished).

- `client.py`: Houses the client-side code for player interaction and gameplay (unfinished).

- `Coordinates.py`: Defines functions and classes for managing coordinates within the game.

- `Player.py`: Contains definitions for different player types, such as player vs. player or player vs. CPU.

- `Ship.py`: Provides functionality for creating and managing ships within the game.

- `Func.py`: Contains essential functions and game logic for the Sea Battle game.

- `Game_Running.py`: The entry point to start the Sea Battle game.

- `grafiks.py`: Handles the graphical elements and display of the game (unfinished).

## Usage

Unfortunately, due to the incomplete nature of the project, running the game in its current state is not possible. However, you are encouraged to explore the codebase, study the functions and classes defined in each file, and use it as a reference for your own projects involving interprocess communication and terminal-based games.

## Contributing

Contributions to this project are welcome. If you are interested in completing the game, improving its functionality, or adding new features, please feel free to fork the repository and submit pull requests.
